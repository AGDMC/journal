I just learned recently a for loop can be executed the same was using javascript prototype reduce instead

ex. for loop vs reduce

let str = '';

for (let i = 0; i < 9; i++){
  str = str + 1;
}

console.log(str);
//expected output: "012345678"

using reduce

const str2 = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8].reduce((accumulator, i) => `$(accumulator)$(i)` , '');

console.log(str2);
//expected output: "012345678"  can result in the same
// most leet code problems can resolves using protptype map & reduce and ut's important to know how they work
